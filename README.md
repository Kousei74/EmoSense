# EmoSense

This project demonstrates the creation and deployment of an emotion detection web application using Watson AI and Flask. The application goes beyond sentiment analysis by detecting more nuanced emotions such as joy, sadness, and anger from text inputs.

## Features

- **Emotion Detection:**  
  Developed using the Watson NLP library, this application analyzes text input to identify emotions like joy, sadness, and anger.
  
- **User-Friendly Output:**  
  The application outputs well-formatted, easily understandable emotion results for users.

- **Web Deployment:**  
  Deployed as a web application using Flask, making it accessible online.

- **Error Handling:**  
  Robust error handling ensures smooth performance, even when unexpected inputs are encountered.

- **Static Code Analysis:**  
  Code quality is ensured through static analysis, with adherence to best practices.

## Project Tasks

### 1. Clone the Project Repository
I cloned the project repository to my local environment, allowing me to work with the necessary code and resources. The original project link is [here](https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/oaqjp-final-project-emb-ai.git), but I used my own repository for deployment, which you can find [here](https://github.com/Nooraldin2001/Final-Project-Emotion-Detector).

### 2. Create an Emotion Detection Application
Utilized the Watson NLP library to develop the emotion detection application, which analyzes text inputs and identifies the underlying emotions.

### 3. Format the Output
Ensured that the applicationâ€™s output is user-friendly and well-formatted, making it easy for users to interpret the detected emotions.

### 4. Package the Application
Packaged the application for ease of deployment, including clear instructions for deployment.

### 5. Run Unit Tests
Thoroughly tested the application to validate its behavior, ensuring that it functions as expected.

### 6. Deploy as a Web Application Using Flask
Deployed the emotion detection app as a Flask-based web application, making it accessible to users online.

### 7. Incorporate Error Handling
Implemented error handling to ensure the application can gracefully manage unexpected inputs.

### 8. Run Static Code Analysis
Performed static code analysis to check for potential issues and maintain high code quality.
